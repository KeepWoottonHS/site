                <h2>OUR COMMUNITY IS BEING SPLIT APART</h2>
                <p>For years, our neighborhoods have been united as part of the Wootton High School community. Now our community is being torn apart based on housing type alone—forcing townhome families out while single-family homes stay. This deliberate division of neighbors is UNACCEPTABLE and we will not stand for it!</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="humanity-box">
                <h2>WE ARE NOT JUST NUMBERS</h2>
                <p>We are not just numbers. We are families. Our children deserve more than a model of efficiency—they deserve community stability, social continuity, and educational equity that respects the whole child. We are families who have worked decades to build the "village" we have. This isn't just about lines on a map—it's about real kids being separated from their friends, their support systems, and the communities they've grown up in.<br><br>When MCPS says it values "student stability" and minimizing school splits, it's heartbreaking and confusing to see proposals that do exactly the opposite. No part of our community should be treated as disposable or "the exception." If Rio/Washingtonian is prioritized to stay together, why not Stonebridge? Why not Stone Mill as a whole?<br><br>There is a conscious choice to leave out the humanity in this decision. The mental health and emotional wellbeing of our children must be a central factor in these decisions—not an afterthought.</p>

                <h2>What's at Stake</h2>
                <p>The proposed school district reorganization will remove our neighborhoods from Wootton High School, impacting:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 15px 0 15px 30px;">
                    <li><strong>Unfair Targeting:</strong> Only townhome families are affected while single-family homes remain at Wootton</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Choice:</strong> We chose to raise our children here because of the high-quality education provided by the Wootton Cluster</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety Concerns:</strong> The new plan requires dangerous commutes across major highways like MD-Route 28</li>
                    <li><strong>Housing Stability:</strong> Families with recent mortgages will be destabilized with this sudden change</li>

                <h2>Safety Risks and Dangerous Commutes</h2>
                <p>The proposed redistricting to Crown High School creates serious safety concerns for our children:</p>
                
                <ul style="margin: 15px 0 15px 30px;">
                    <li><strong>Hazardous Travel Routes:</strong> Students will be forced to cross major highways including MD-Route 28 and MD-Route 119 (Great Seneca Highway)</li>
                    <li><strong>Longer Commutes:</strong> Increased travel time on riskier roads with more traffic</li>
                    <li><strong>Dangerous Intersections:</strong> Multiple high-traffic crossings that pose daily safety risks</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Wootton provides one of the safest learning environments in the county. Why should our children be forced into a more dangerous situation when they could continue in the secure, supportive environment they've always known?</p>

            <div class="action-section">
                <h2>An Unfair Division</h2>
                <p>This redistricting proposal creates an unjust split within our community—townhome families are being forced out of Wootton while single-family homes will have multiple pathways to remain at Wootton.</p>
                
                <p>This arbitrary housing-type division undermines the community bonds and educational continuity that brought us here in the first place.</p>

            <div class="action-section">
                <h2>Illogical Boundary Decisions</h2>
                <p>The boundary study has created a completely illogical redistricting plan that defies basic geography and common sense:</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Washingtonian Wedge</strong> is located directly across from Crown High School—literally within walking distance—yet families there have options to remain at Wootton.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Our community</strong> is an hour-long walk away from Crown High School, yet we have been given no options to stay at Wootton despite our greater distance and established connection to the school.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Additionally:</strong> According to MCPS itself, Wootton is the only school of the ones being changed to Crown which is neither overcrowded nor even expected to be overcrowded. This means the diversion of our community into Crown is needless and a solution in search of a problem.</p>
                
                <p>This geographic disparity reveals the arbitrary and unfair nature of the redistricting process. Why should families living closer to Crown get choices while families living farther away are forced to switch? The boundary study has failed to consider basic logic and fairness in their decision-making.</p>

                <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
                <p>We need immediate community action to advocate for keeping our neighborhoods in the Wootton district. Your support helps fund legal advocacy, community organizing, and outreach efforts to preserve our school choice and protect our children's safety and education.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Even if you don't have children, this affects our entire community. The strength of our neighborhood comes from the unity and shared identity we've built around the Wootton Cluster. Breaking up our community weakens the bonds that make this such a desirable place to live and call home.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Every contribution makes a difference in our fight to maintain the educational continuity and safe environment our community deserves.</p>
